# Coma

## Overview

> A small library to help with the data management of computational condensed
> matter physics projects.

Coma is the Computational Condensed Matter Physics Programming Toolkit. This is
the second iteration of the library (version 2.x.x) which is different from and
incompatible with [version 1][1].

## Installation

Coma requires Python 2.7. Older or newer versions won't work. To install the
Python module, go to the Coma source directory and run the `setup.py` file.
    
    $ ./setup.py install --user

For the time being, we recommend to install to your home directory, and that's
what the `--user` switch does.
